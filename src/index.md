I am a postdoc under [Stratis Skoulakis](https://sskoul.github.io/) at Aarhus University. Before working with Stratis, I obtained my Ph.D. degree under supervision from [Ioannis Caragiannis](https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/). I got my master's degree at Aarhus Univeristy and my bachelor's degree at [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/e_jsjxy/), [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). 

I am working on various problems in algorithmic game theory, such as mechanism design with divisible items and equilibrium computation. I am also open with any interesting problem in theoretical computer science. Before I jumped into theory, I did some research in reinforcement learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

My CV is [here](./CV_Zhile.pdf).
