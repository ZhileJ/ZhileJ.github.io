I am a second-year PhD student supervised by [Ioannis Caragiannis](https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/) at Aarhus University. I study in algorithmic game theory. Before working with Iannis, I obtained my master's degree at Aarhus Univeristy. I got my bachelor's degree at [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/e_jsjxy/), [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). During my bachelor study, I did some research in reinforcement learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

Now, I am working on various problems in algorithmic game theory, such as computing equilibrium, pricing, and stable matching. And I am also open with any interesting problem in theoretical computer science.

My CV is [here](./CV_Zhile.pdf).
